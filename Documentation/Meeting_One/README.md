Questions
- Is there a specific platform you would like us to use?
- Do you want us to update it based on the user's GPS?
- What language would you like the app in?
- Would it be a useful feature to include a toggle with an option where you can return 3 choices
  for where to eat and choose one from that and the other option just returns one? Or maybe include
  a feature where you can select how many return options you would like.
- What should the app be doing after selecting the restaurant? Example: Pulls up a link to the restaurant
  for you to look at the menu, reviews, location, etc...
