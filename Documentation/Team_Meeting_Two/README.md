# Team Meeting Two

### During this meeting we went over the information discussed in [Customer Meeting](https://github.com/ACHarrison32/Software-Engineering---Lunch-Decider-App/tree/main/Documentation/Customer_Meeting_One).

### Talked about creating sketches of the application based off what we individuallly precieve it may look like. We also discussed about creating sketches of our logo individually so that we may compare them and choose which one we like best.
### You can find these sketches here at: [Sketches](https://github.com/ACHarrison32/Software-Engineering---Lunch-Decider-App/tree/main/Documentation/Sketches)
