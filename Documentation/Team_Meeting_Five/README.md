# Objective Grading Meeting

### This meeting discussed the [Objective Grading Sheet](https://github.com/ACHarrison32/Software-Engineering---Lunch-Decider-App/blob/main/Documentation/Objective%20Grading%20Sheet.pdf) and how to properly split tasks amongst the team members. This is to help everyone achieve around 100 points each. 

### The [Objective Grading Sheet](https://github.com/ACHarrison32/Software-Engineering---Lunch-Decider-App/blob/main/Documentation/Objective%20Grading%20Sheet.pdf) posted if our hopeful semester long task division. This is not the finalized version.
