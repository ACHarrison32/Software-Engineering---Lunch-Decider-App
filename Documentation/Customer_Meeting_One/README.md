# First Customer Meeting

## Who is the customer
Our customer said to think of her as Yelp, and that they want us to make an app for them.

## Platform and language
We decided on making the application on Android. We also talked about how once we are finished with the Android app we could possibly make it web based as well. The customer did not have any preferance on what language we used. We decided it would be best to use Java for the applciation.

## Design
We discussed with the customer about having the user fill out certain criteria such as food type, money amount, distance, restaurant type, and review rating. We talked about how you then can have it choose how many outputs it would like. It would do an animation such as a spin the wheel, or pulling from a deck of cards, or any other. Then once the animation is done and it shows you the restaurant it will also display an image logo of the place, will show how it matches your criteria, and will display a link to Yelp so that you can check out reviews. We also talked about how having an option that allows you to look up restaurants and favorite them. After that it would allow you to spin by favorite. So instead of it choosing a random restaurant for you, it could choose a restaurant of your choice. Also having a spin results button for if you have multiple outputs and you want it to choose between them again.

## Location Questions
We talked about how Android would ask about location services. If a user decided to say no to location services it would still allow them to put their zip code into the app to find restaurants in that area.
We discussed that we would start with having the app be based solely in wichita falls. However once we have a working app for the wichita falls area we wanted to expand statewide. Once we are able to get it statewide we then wanted to look at getting it nationwide.

## Profiles
We decieded on not allowing users to create profiles due to possible security risks. However we want to make it so that it remembers the last restaurant choice it gave you. The reason for this is so that once you log back into the app it could ask you if you enjoyed eating at "name of restaurant", it would also have a link to Yelp so that you leave a positive or negative review of the restaurant.

## Database
Since our customer wants us to think of her as Yelp, we are going to use Yelp's database to answer our application criteria questions.
