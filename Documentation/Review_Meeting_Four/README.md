# Lunch Roulette Application Navigation Diagram Review
## Timeline:
### • 7:00 PM: Start Meeting
### • 7:00 - 7:10 PM: Discussed what the diagram needed to be. Our first draft of the navigation diagram was not quite what was needed
### • 7:10 - 7:13 PM: Discussed removing the Yelp section from draft because its not actually part of the UI
### • 7:13 - 7:15 PM: Decided to remove the “options/restaurants” and “favorites list” from diagram since it’s included with the “create list” and ”list” section
### • 7:15 - 7:17 PM: Removed the “edit criteria” section of the diagram because it was not needed
### • 7:17 - 7:18 PM: Removed the “Home page” section. We do not have a home page therefore do not need it in the diagram
### • 7:18 - 7:20 PM: Moved the “create list” and “list” page and put it under the “spin wheel” page since the “spin wheel” page is the first thing you see when opening the app
### • 7:20 - 7:21 PM: Added an arrow from “list” page and “spin wheel” page
### • 7:17 - 7:18 PM: End Meeting
