This application will use a user-friendly interface that allows you to interact with
different features. Tabs, drop-down menus, swipe menus, and the use of a mouse
and keyboard will be implemented. An animated wheel will be used for deciding
what restaurant you eat from. There will be multiple tabs that will direct you to
another page such as create lists, edit criteria, and spin options. The app will
implement a search menu that allows you to search for a restaurant. There will also
be an add to favorite button when searching for restaurants.

The user is going to be able to open up the app and just instantly spin the wheel to
get an option of where to eat at. Not only can you just spin to find a random
restaurant, but you’ll also be able to spin by a favorites list and create your own
personal lists with specific criteria to spin by. The application will also be able to
store your previous list's data for easy and fast access the next time the user uses
the app.

In addition, the customer would also like for us to have some specific features for
the users. The customer would like for us to have a take me to Yelp area in the
output choices. For this, whenever a restaurant choice is outputted, specific criteria
based on what you filled out will appear as well as a link to yelp so you read
reviews and write any if you’d like to. The customer would also like for us to
create a web-based version of the application as well.

The main objective of this project is to produce three prototypes that build from
one another. Each prototype will be broken up into three separate parts. After the
first prototype is finished the team will present it to the customer to get feedback.
After feedback, the team will start the second prototype that addresses the issues in
prototype 1. Once again, when prototype two is finished the team will present the
product to the customer to get feedback. Once the team receives feedback about
prototype two, the team will start on prototype three. This will be the final
prototype the team will complete. During this, the team will fix up any last details
that failed to be completed in prototype two. Prototype three will then be delivered
to the customer for use.
